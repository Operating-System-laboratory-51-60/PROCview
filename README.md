## Problem Statement

Write a code to create a user command `my_ps` such that it merges the information of commands `ps aux` & `ps -eLf`; desired output shown below.

**Prerequisites**: Basic file handling use of `open()`, `close()`, `fscanf()`, `fprintf()`; use of `system()`.

**Hint**: You may use the system call `system()` to execute commands:
- `ps aux >> x1.txt`
- `ps –eLf >> x2.txt`

Open both the text files, extract information using `fscanf()`, and write the combined information as desired in another output text file `merged.txt`. Display the file `merged.txt` in the terminal. Compile and save the exe file as `my_ps` which can behave like a command.

## Project Structure

This repository contains two different implementations of the problem statement:

### 1. Our Solution (`/Our Solution`)
This is the primary, modular implementation of the project. It splits the logic into multiple files for better maintainability and includes an interactive menu system.

- **Key Features**:
  - Modular Code (`my_ps.c`, `parser.c`, `file_handler.c`)
  - Interactive CLI Menu (`interface.c`) to build and run the tool easily.
  - Clean separation of concerns (Parsing vs. File I/O vs. Main Logic).

### 2. AI Generated (`/AI Generated`)
A single-file implementation generated by AI, which serves as a quick reference or alternative approach.

- **Key Files**:
  - `solution.c`: A standalone C file containing all logic.
  - `auto_runner.py`: A Python script to automatically compile and run the solution.

## Getting Started

To use the recommended solution:

1. Navigate to the solution folder:
   ```bash
   cd "Our Solution"
   ```

2. Follow the instructions in the [Solution README](./Our%20Solution/README.md) to compile and run the tool.
